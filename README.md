# Developing a Geospatial Recommendation Engine with K-Means Clustering

## This project aims to harness the power of machine learning through the K-Means clustering algorithm to create a location-based restaurant recommendation system. By leveraging user geolocation data from the comprehensive Yelp Dataset, the engine will provide highly relevant dining suggestions, enhancing user experience and decision-making efficiency in real-world scenarios.
